                <p className='text-gray-500 font-medium'>
                    The icons are in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) format. They can be imported into
                    your design tool of choice and used directly in code.

                <h2 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Can I use the icons at different sizes?</h2>
                <p className='text-gray-500 font-medium'>
                    Yes. The icons are drawn on a 24 x 24 pixel grid, but the icons can be scaled to
                    different sizes as needed. We don&#39;t recommend going smaller than 20 x 20 or
                    larger than 64 x 64 to retain legibility and visual balance.

                <p className='text-gray-500 font-medium'>
                    No. You are allowed to use these icons freely in your personal and professional
                    work. If you enjoy the icon pack, feel free to tell others!
